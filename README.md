Bank - Power BI Dashboard Project
In this project, I built a complete Power BI dashboard by extracting and modeling banking data from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), applying Star Schema best practices, and creating insightful visualizations for business decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Data Loading and Modeling:

Pulled raw customer account and transaction data directly from SSMS.

Structured the data using a Star Schema:

Fact Table: Account transactions and balances.

Dimension Tables: Customers, Branches, Loan Types, Time Periods.

This model enabled fast query performance and simplified data relationships.

ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Overview:
Built with Microsoft Power BI Desktop, the dashboard highlights key banking KPIs:

Total Customers: 100

Active Accounts: 74

Dormant Accounts: 100

Year-To-Date Payments: $11.13K

Average Days Since Last Activity: 793.69 days

ðŸ”¹ Visualizations and Analytics:

Loan Balances by Loan ID and Loan Size Category (Large loans = 99% of total balances)

Transaction vs Dormant Account Analysis (88% active accounts)

Monthly Transaction Trends (steady transaction growth in 2023)

Loan Type Analysis: Comparing Mortgage, Auto, and Personal loan accounts.

ðŸ”¹ Key Business Insights:

A significant concentration in large loan accounts boosts the bank's revenue base.

High customer engagement through active accounts.

Mortgages dominate the loan portfolio.

Transaction trends indicate stable growth, useful for forecasting.

Why This Project Matters
This project showcases how to use Power BI with SQL databases to create powerful business dashboards for the banking sector. Using a Star Schema model ensured scalability and efficiency, while Power BIâ€™s visual storytelling transformed raw data into actionable insights.

If you're looking to analyze customer accounts, predict banking trends, or optimize financial portfolios, a properly modeled Power BI dashboard like this one is the perfect solution.
